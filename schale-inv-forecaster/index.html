>This tool is WIP, for calculating possibilities
of Settlement Task event in Blue Archive.

The algorithm is not done yet, it might take
too long on certain combinations.

Note that this tool explores all possibilities
and treat them all equally, which might be
inaccurate.

The theoretically best way of solving this event
is having someone host a database that collects
solved pattern from worldwide senseis, because
it seems like they're not fully random generated.
Noticed it when there's multiple same pattern
in a chat group i'm in. Could it be picked by
BA devs? idk..</p>
